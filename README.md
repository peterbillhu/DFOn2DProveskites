## Requirments

numpy >= 1.21.2

## File Descriptions

The Density Fingerprint algorithm was initially introduced by Edelsbrunner et al. [1]. In this study, we present an implemented algorithm designed for efficiently calculating the density fingerprint of a given atomic system, comprising both the unit cell and motif set.


## Google Notebook Tutorial

To ensure the function of the proposed algorithms, we provide a Google Notebook tutorial to demonstrate how to generate the density fingerprint of a given unit cell and motif set. In the demonstration, we exhibit toy examples as shown in the above section.
